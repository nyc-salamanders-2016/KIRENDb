# KIRENDb

## Welcome, here's what I've done so far:

* Search for a movie and query the OMDB API
* After querying, the search's API URL and Poster URL are saved in an object, that will later be used for listing out previous searches (images that link to the API url - clicking them will call the same API over again)
